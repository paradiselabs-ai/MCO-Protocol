# MCO Visual Setup Tool Design

## Overview

Based on our successful validation of the MCO Server with the LM Studio Python SDK, we've designed a visual setup tool to streamline MCO configuration and integration. This tool will enable developers to integrate MCO orchestration into their agentic workflows in under 30 minutes, focusing most of their time on defining orchestration logic rather than technical setup.

## Design Principles

1. **Preserve SNLP Structure**: Maintain the Syntactical Natural Language Programming approach that makes MCO effective
2. **Minimize Technical Overhead**: Reduce integration time to under 30 minutes
3. **Framework Agnostic**: Support multiple AI agent frameworks through adapters
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Guide users through configuration in logical steps
5. **Visual Workflow**: Provide visual representation of orchestration flow

## Core Components

### 1. MCO Studio Web Application

A browser-based application for creating and managing MCO configurations:

#### Key Features:

- **Visual Workflow Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating workflow steps
- **SNLP Editor**: Specialized editor for MCO files with syntax highlighting and validation
- **Template Gallery**: Pre-built templates for common use cases
- **Live Preview**: Real-time visualization of orchestration flow
- **Validation Tools**: Automatic validation of MCO configuration

### 2. Integration Wizard

A step-by-step wizard for connecting MCO to existing agent frameworks:

#### Steps:

1. **Framework Selection**: Choose target framework (LM Studio, AgentGPT, SuperExpert, etc.)
2. **Configuration**: Set framework-specific parameters
3. **Connection Test**: Verify connection to framework
4. **Code Generation**: Generate integration code for selected framework
5. **Deployment Options**: Choose deployment method (local, Docker, cloud)

### 3. Orchestration Dashboard

A monitoring and management interface for running orchestrations:

#### Features:

- **Orchestration Status**: Real-time status of running orchestrations
- **Step Visualization**: Visual representation of current step and progress
- **Log Viewer**: Detailed logs for debugging
- **Success Criteria Tracking**: Monitor progress toward success criteria
- **Performance Metrics**: Track execution time and resource usage

## User Flows

### 1. New User Flow

1. **Welcome & Introduction**: Brief overview of MCO and its benefits
2. **Template Selection**: Choose from pre-built templates or start from scratch
3. **Core Configuration**: Define basic workflow and success criteria
4. **Features & Styles**: Add optional features and styling preferences
5. **Framework Connection**: Connect to existing agent framework
6. **Deployment**: Deploy MCO Server and start orchestration

### 2. Experienced User Flow

1. **Dashboard**: View existing orchestrations and their status
2. **Configuration Editor**: Directly edit MCO files with advanced tools
3. **Adapter Management**: Configure and test framework adapters
4. **Deployment Management**: Manage deployed orchestrations

## Technical Architecture

The visual setup tool will be built on:

1. **Frontend**: React-based web application with TypeScript
2. **Backend**: Python FastAPI server connecting to MCO Server
3. **Storage**: Local file system for configurations, SQLite for state
4. **Deployment**: Electron for desktop app, Docker for containerization

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1 (2-3 weeks)**: Core MCO Studio with basic workflow builder
2. **Phase 2 (1-2 weeks)**: Integration Wizard for LM Studio
3. **Phase 3 (1-2 weeks)**: Orchestration Dashboard
4. **Phase 4 (2-3 weeks)**: Additional framework adapters and deployment options

## Success Metrics

The visual setup tool will be considered successful if:

1. **Integration Time**: New users can integrate MCO in under 30 minutes
2. **Usability**: 90% of users can successfully create and deploy an orchestration
3. **Framework Support**: At least 3 major AI agent frameworks supported
4. **Adoption**: Increasing trend in weekly active users

## Conclusion

The MCO Visual Setup Tool will significantly reduce the barrier to entry for MCO adoption while preserving the powerful SNLP approach that makes MCO effective. By focusing on user experience and minimizing technical overhead, we can achieve our goal of making MCO a standard protocol for AI agent orchestration.
